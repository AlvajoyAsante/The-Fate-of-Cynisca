### Overview

**The Fate of Cynisca** is a single-player, fast-paced racing game inspired by Greek mythology. Step into the sandals of **Cynisca of Sparta**, the first female Olympic champion, as you defy the gods themselves to rescue your family.

When the gods grow jealous of Cynisca’s unmatched chariot racing skill, they kidnap her husband and children. To win them back, Cynisca must face off against the sly and merciless gods of Olympus — racing through treacherous terrain, divine obstacles, and mythic challenges to reclaim her destiny.

### Storyline

The Greek gods didn’t appreciate being outdone by a mortal — especially not a woman. When Cynisca began defeating even their divine offspring in chariot races, Zeus took revenge.
He captured her loved ones and issued a challenge: *“Race us, mortal, if you dare — or lose your family forever.”*

You’ll race through three major levels, each with personal stakes:

* **Level 1** – Win back your **son**.
* **Level 2** – Rescue your **daughter**.
* **Level 3** – Reclaim your **husband** and defy the gods once and for all.

### Gameplay Summary

* **Objective:** Win races against Greek gods to free Cynisca’s family.
* **Mechanics:** High-speed chariot racing, obstacle avoidance, and myth-inspired power-ups.
* **Environment:** Race across the clouds of Mount Olympus, the fiery tracks of Hades, and the shining plains of Elysium.
